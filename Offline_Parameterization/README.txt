Tool	: Offline Parameterisation Tool
Language: Perl
OS	: Any
Warning	: Nil

I wrote this script basically as a Part of a work.
This script will read Parameter Names from an existing m script and update the Parameter along with the new values
from the given DCM.
By means of this we can parameterise the model offline with any DCM.
By loading the m script in to our matlab workspace we can make sure that the new values are updated and the
performance of the system varies accordingly
